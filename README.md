### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My main languages are **Java**, **C++** & **C**.
I also use **JavaScript** & **Python**.

I have sysadmin skills as in **Database management** (creation, integration & maintenance), **Cybersecurity** (firewall, prevent port scan, prevent bruteforce...), **Docker** (single containers, multi containers with docker-compose), **Redis** (simple cache, channels)...

I have already created several infrastructures for video games that have welcomed 400 people simultaneously at their peak. So I know what it's like to be in charge of a production line. In this context, I had a few developers working with me and for whom I was responsible.

I work on Linux, Mac and Windows and I conclude that my dream would be to create a cross-platform OS to simplify the user and developer experience.
